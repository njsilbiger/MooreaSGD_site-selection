Sled deployed at Cabral at 19:00 on 3/14/2 and moved closer to the seep on 3/29/22 at 17:55. Sled was possibly moved by Airbnb inhabitants / Mr. Cabral prior to this. Shortly after the 3/29/22 move sled was brought in, offloaded (without stopping most loggers), and redeployed on 3/29/22 at 19:30. Sled calibrated in the field. Third lux logger in place of PAR.
