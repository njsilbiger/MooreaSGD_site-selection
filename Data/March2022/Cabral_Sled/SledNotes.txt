Sled deployed at Cabral at 19:00 on 2022-03-14 and moved closer to the seep (CSEEPMARCH2022) on 2022-03-29 at 17:55. Sled was moved by Airbnb inhabitants / Mr. Cabral prior to this, potentially on the 2022-03-25/27. Shortly after the 2022-03-29 move the sled was brought in and offloaded without stopping most loggers. Sled calibrated in the field. Third lux logger in place of PAR. 

Sled redeployed on 2022-03-29 at 19:30. Sled retrieved on 2022-03-31 at 13:00. Water level hobo needs to be post processed. CT calibration point in separate folder. 


Sled redeployed on 2022-03-31 at 15:30 and retrieved on 2022-04-03 at 8:00. Held at 15:14, 15:16, 15:18 on 2022-03-31 and on 8:42, 8:44 on 2022-04-03. Pressure logger won't allow for data processing in HOBO. Sled calibrated in the field. 


Calibration notes (post-processing)
- 3/14/2022 processed using 3/31/2022 post calibration (drifts terribly until moved by unknown person 3/26/2022 to the deeper tire location)
- After processing using above calibration point, then corrected for drift 3/14-3/26 by using a calibrated EC value as 3/14 pre and using stable calibrated 3/26 EC as post.
- Attempted to correct for drift by using high value post-move as calibration value for last low value before sled was moved 3/26
- Edited Launch_Log.csv and CTLoggerIDMetadata.csv: end date from 3/29/2022 9:00AM to 3/26/2022 15:22
